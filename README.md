3d-printer-calibration-files
============================

I couldn't find a good one-stop-shop for calibration files, so I'm going to create my own.

My goal is to create a set of:

- Parametric scad files (so you can tune as you see fit!)
- Name/order them so you (and I!) calibrate in the correct order
- Continually build on these as I come up with better tests.

Suggestions, feedback and pull-requests welcome!
